    <h1>League of Legends Data Analysis Project</h1>
    <p>This project explores the League of Legends dataset to understand key metrics such as damage per minute (dmp) across different leagues and player positions.</p>
    
    <h2>Dataset Choice</h2>
    <p><strong>Dataset:</strong> League of Legends ⌨️</p>
    <p><strong>Reason for Choice:</strong> I chose this dataset because I play this game and think it is interesting.</p>
    
    <h2>Visualization</h2>
    <p>Below is a plotly visualization created during the exploratory data analysis phase:</p>

    <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
    <p><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> There is no difference in the mean game damage per minute (dmp) between LPL and other tier one leagues (LCK, LEC, LCS).</p>
    <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> LPL has a higher mean game dmp compared to the other tier one leagues (LCK, LEC, LCS).</p>
    <p><strong>Test Statistic:</strong> Mean game dmp (damage per minute).</p>

    <h2>Prediction</h2>
    <p><strong>Column to Predict:</strong> Player position.</p>
    <p><strong>Type of Problem:</strong> Classification.</p>
